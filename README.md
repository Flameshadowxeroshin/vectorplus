VectorPLUS
==========
VectorPLUS is a bioinformatics aide written by prototypical college students Henry Ward and Jack Walstrom.

Currently, it can do one thing and one thing only: find a given gene sequence within a larger sequence and
outputs its regulatory region, given the size of said region. Reads and writes only using fasta files.
